      Early Warning System to identify undergraduate ITAM students in scholar vulnerability in the next
      two years. In particular, we used metrics based on assistive or punitive actions to optimize the 
      models, performed temporal cross-validation, and used existing methodologies for analyzing algorithmic 
      bias and fairness among student groups. My responsibilities included structuring databases, exploring 
      data patterns, and implementing training and validation of machine learning models to generate risk 
      score predictions for each student.
