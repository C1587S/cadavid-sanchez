      In the 1990s, after experiencing high levels of inflation, several countries in Latin America passed constitutional 
      amendments providing greater autonomy to their central banks. A few years later, many central banks increased their 
      exchange rate flexibility and later adopted inflation targeting frameworks. These institutional changes coincided with 
      sharp reductions in inflation and its variability. In this paper, we ask if the observed reduction of inflation is possibly 
      related to changes in monetary policy. To answer this question, we build and estimate a Markov-Switching Dsge model for an 
      open economy with monetary factors for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, all of whom formally adopted inflation 
      targeting regimes between 1999 and 2002. Regimes are classified according to their relative weights of inflation in an interest 
      rate reaction function. Although ex-ante these regimes need not be associated with introducing the inflation-targeting framework, 
      the coincidence of a regime switch with a more responsive interest rate - inflation relationship is striking.
      Furthermore, the Markov-Switching Dsge model allows us to generate counterfactuals of what could have happened if the observed 
      change towards a more aggressive fight against inflation had not occurred. In general, we observe that if monetary policy had 
      remained dovish, these countries would have experienced higher and more variable levels of inflation and more pronounced variations 
      in GDP with small gains in average economic growth. Therefore, we conclude that the introduction of inflation targeting represented 
      a favorable regime switch in implementing monetary policy in Latin America.
