      This paper analyzes the role of fiscal and monetary policies in the determination of inflation and government debt 
      in Mexico during the 1981-2016 period. A Markov-switching DSGE model estimation allows us to identify five different 
      periods of fiscal and monetary policy interactions congruent with a historical account of the Mexican monetary and 
      fiscal policy mix during the past 35 years. Counterfactual exercises show that the low-frequency evolution of inflation 
      is mainly determined by the monetary policy stance, while the fiscal policy stance mainly determines the low-frequency 
      evolution of debt. We show that if monetary dominance prevailed throughout the whole period, the average inflation would 
      have been 13.2% rather than the 20.4% observed. On the other hand, complete fiscal dominance would have implied average 
      inflation of 42% and an average debt five times larger than the observed.
