## Introduction

In Schooling markets, education services are exchanged, and the supply side is composed of school institutions competing to enroll students. The impact of competition among schools leads to increases in education quality by signaling factors. As highlighted by [Mizala and Urquiola (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387813000333), a critical factor that likely determines the impact of competition is explained by whether parents are informed about schools' effectiveness or value-added and how it influences their school choices. 

However, school market identification could include different definitions and approaches. This work explores a new methodology to detect school markets at elementary and high school levels using geospatial analysis and data from school student migrations in Mexico between 2006 and 2013.
