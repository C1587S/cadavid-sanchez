## Methodology

We define a school market as a community where students have migrated between schools and is defined within a commuting  zone. In this section, we will explain briefly how each of those elements is calculated.

### Data Sources

#### School Data

The data used for collecting administrative and geographic information of schools comes from several resources. We validated information between data sources from [Instituto Nacional de la Infraestructura Física Educativa (INIFED)](https://www.gob.mx/inifed), [Instituto Nacional para la Evaluación de la Educación (INEE)](https://historico.mejoredu.gob.mx/evaluaciones/sire/sire-bases-de-datos/), and [Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP)](https://www.gob.mx/sep). We collected information for XX schools at primary school level, and XX for high school levels. 

#### Students migration

We collected information from students who switched schools (s*witchers*) from data provided by the SEP on the [ENLACE](http://dgece.sev.gob.mx/difusion/resultadosenlace/) (Evaluación Nacional de Logros Académicos en Centros Escolares) standardized test. As we use data from those tests yearly, we identify which students presented the ENLACE test in different locations and are considered the as _switchers_.
