## Introduction

In Schooling Markets (SM), education services are exchanged. The supply side is composed of school institutions competing to enroll students, while the demand side is formed by students' parents who choose where to enroll their children. As [Mizala and Urquiola (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387813000333) highlighted, a critical factor that likely determines the impact of competition within markets is explained by whether parents are informed about schools' effectiveness or value-added and how it influences their school choices. Public policy programs could enhance schools' competition over education quality by increasing parents' information on this field. 

However, SM identification is not a trivial task and could include different definitions and approaches. This work proposes a novel methodology for detecting school markets at elementary and high school levels using geospatial analysis for calculating _Commuting Zones_ (CZ), and graph algorithms for community detection using student migrations data in Mexico between 2006 and 2013. On this page, I will summarize the methodologies that we use to complete our goal.
