A few years later, many central banks increased their exchange rate flexibility and later adopted inflation targeting frameworks. These institutional changes coincided with sharp reductions in inflation and its variability. In this paper, we ask if the observed reduction of inflation is possibly related to changes in monetary policy. To answer this question, we build and estimate a Markov-Switching DSGE model for an open economy with monetary factors for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, all of whom formally adopted inflation targeting regimes between 1999 and 2002. Regimes are classified according to their relative weights of inflation in an interest rate reaction function. Although ex-ante these regimes need not be associated with introducing the inflation-targeting framework, the coincidence of a regime switch with a more responsive interest rate - inflation relationship is striking. Furthermore, the Markov-Switching Dsge model allows us to generate counterfactuals of what could have happened if the observed change towards a more aggressive fight against inflation had not occurred. In general, we observe that if monetary policy had remained dovish, these countries would have experienced higher and more variable levels of inflation and more pronounced variations in GDP with small gains in average economic growth. Therefore, we conclude that the introduction of inflation targeting represented a favorable regime switch in implementing monetary policy in Latin America."))),i.a.createElement(u.a,{as:"li"},i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("img",{width:120,height:190,className:"mr-3",src:w,alt:"Generic placeholder"}),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("img",{width:120,height:120,className:"mr-3",src:b,alt:"Generic placeholder"})),i.a.createElement(u.a.Body,null,i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/41059",target:"_blank"},i.a.createElement("h5",{class:"colored_heading_h5"},"Monetary Policy and Structural Changes in Colombia: A Markov Switching Approach")),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"p_ind"},"This paper analyzes the Colombian economic context between 1990Q1-2016Q4, using a Markov-Switching Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model (MS-DSGE) to identify regime switches in the driven mechanisms of the economy.

The results support evidence of shifts in the structural parameters of several equations that define the dynamics of the economy. The best fit specification of the MSDSGE model allows for independent switches in the Taylor rule, parameters, coefficients of the domestic Phillips curve, and changes in volatilities. Estimations from the DSGE model suggest a regime switching in monetary policy from a low to high inflation response, which coincides with the adoption of inflation targeting in 1999Q3, and with a lower Phillips curve slope in the Economy since 1998Q3. Historical decomposition analysis and counterfactual exercises show that regime switches were crucial when the Central Bank adopted an Inflation Targeting regime, and, by themselves, these regime changes could be interpreted as disinflationary shocks.
