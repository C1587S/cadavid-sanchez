A few years later, many central banks increased their exchange rate flexibility and later adopted inflation targeting frameworks. These institutional changes coincided with sharp reductions in inflation and its variability. In this paper, we ask if the observed reduction of inflation is possibly related to changes in monetary policy. To answer this question, we build and estimate a Markov-Switching DSGE model for an open economy with monetary factors for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, all of whom formally adopted inflation targeting regimes between 1999 and 2002. Regimes are classified according to their relative weights of inflation in an interest rate reaction function. Although ex-ante these regimes need not be associated with introducing the inflation-targeting framework, the coincidence of a regime switch with a more responsive interest rate - inflation relationship is striking. Furthermore, the Markov-Switching Dsge model allows us to generate counterfactuals of what could have happened if the observed change towards a more aggressive fight against inflation had not occurred. In general, we observe that if monetary policy had remained dovish, these countries would have experienced higher and more variable levels of inflation and more pronounced variations in GDP with small gains in average economic growth. Therefore, we conclude that the introduction of inflation targeting represented a favorable regime switch in implementing monetary policy in Latin America."))),i.a.createElement(d.a,{as:"li"},i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("img",{width:120,height:190,className:"mr-3",src:S.a,alt:"Generic placeholder"}),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("img",{width:120,height:120,className:"mr-3",src:M.a,alt:"Generic placeholder"})),i.a.createElement(d.a.Body,null,i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/41059",target:"_blank"},i.a.createElement("h5",{class:"colored_heading_h5"},"Monetary Policy and Structural Changes in Colombia: A Markov Switching Approach")),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"p_ind"},"This paper analyzes the Colombian economic context between 1990Q1-2016Q4, using a Markov-Switching Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model (MS-DSGE) to identify regime switches in the driven mechanisms of the economy. Bayesian methods are applied, allowing for changes in the monetary policy rule, nominal rigidities, and shock volatilities of the model. The results support evidence of shifts in the structural parameters of several equations that define the dynamics of the economy. The best fit specification of the MSDSGE model allows for independent switches in the Taylor rule, parameters, coefficients of the domestic Phillips curve, and changes in volatilities. Estimations from the DSGE model suggest a regime switching in monetary policy from a low to high inflation response, which coincides with the adoption of inflation targeting in 1999Q3, and with a lower Phillips curve slope in the Economy since 1998Q3. Historical decomposition analysis and counterfactual exercises show that regime switches were crucial when the Central Bank adopted an Inflation Targeting regime, and, by themselves, these regime changes could be interpreted as disinflationary shocks.

Meanwhile, in the three episodes where low response to financial factors is observed, if the monetary authority had responded more aggressively, from 1971Q1-1978Q3 it could have attained lower inflation at the cost of lower GDP, from 2000Q4-2004Q4 it could have delayed the GDP contraction to 2002Q3, but this would have been deeper and inflation larger, and in 2006Q1-2009Q4 it might have precipitated the GDP contraction.

Counterfactual exercises show that the low-frequency evolution of inflation is mainly determined by the monetary policy stance, while the fiscal policy stance mainly determines the low-frequency evolution of debt. We show that if monetary dominance prevailed throughout the whole period, the average inflation would have been 13.2% rather than the 20.4% observed.
