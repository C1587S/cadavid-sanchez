A few years later, many central banks increased their exchange rate flexibility and later adopted inflation targeting frameworks. These institutional changes coincided with sharp reductions in inflation and its variability. In this paper, we ask if the observed reduction of inflation is possibly related to changes in monetary policy. To answer this question, we build and estimate a Markov-Switching DSGE model for an open economy with monetary factors for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, all of whom formally adopted inflation targeting regimes between 1999 and 2002. Regimes are classified according to their relative weights of inflation in an interest rate reaction function. Although ex-ante these regimes need not be associated with introducing the inflation-targeting framework, the coincidence of a regime switch with a more responsive interest rate - inflation relationship is striking. Furthermore, the Markov-Switching Dsge model allows us to generate counterfactuals of what could have happened if the observed change towards a more aggressive fight against inflation had not occurred. In general, we observe that if monetary policy had remained dovish, these countries would have experienced higher and more variable levels of inflation and more pronounced variations in GDP with small gains in average economic growth.
