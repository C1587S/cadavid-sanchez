In this project we proposed a methodology for identifying schooling markets in Mexico by using geospatial analysis and graph algorithms for community detection. This work was done with Mauricio Romero (Instituto Tecnológico de México - [Center for Economic Research](http://cie.itam.mx/)), and Paola Mejía ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)).
